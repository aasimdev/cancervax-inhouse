                            <p>There may be hope for pediatric cancer on the horizon as <strong><span>scientists move ever closer to a treatment for Ewing sarcoma</span></strong>, a pervasive and difficult-to-treat cancer that attacks bones and soft tissue, more common in teens and young adults over any other age group. &nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Recently, the <strong><span>research team found the silver bullet:&nbsp;</span></strong>a protein biomarker present on most Ewing sarcoma tumors. &nbsp;Now, they’re targeting that biomarker in the quest to <strong><span>help cancer patients’ immune systems recognize, attack and destroy Ewing sarcoma.</span></strong></p>
                            <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In collaboration with a team of researchers and physicians at UCLA,</span><span><strong>&nbsp;CancerVAX has been working&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>on developing treatments for Ewing sarcoma.</span></strong>&nbsp; It all started with the identification of a common protein biomarker present on the surface of more than 90% of Ewing sarcoma tumors. &nbsp;</p>
                            <p><span><strong>This work is giving rise to treatments</strong></span> that will help spur cancer patients’ own immune systems into action to fight against this otherwise difficult-to-terminate cancer. &nbsp;The treatments could enter early testing phases as early as Spring 2024.</p>
                            <p>For patients fighting Ewing sarcoma, any step forward towards <strong><span>a new viable treatment is a positive one</span></strong>. &nbsp;And for the youngest of these, it could mean <span><strong>a new opportunity to live free from the tubes, needles and stress of cancer,&nbsp;</strong></span>and to live strong within their own bodies.</p>
