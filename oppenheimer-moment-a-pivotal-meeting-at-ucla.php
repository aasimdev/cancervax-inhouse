                        <p>On a warm and sunny August day at the UCLA campus, the CancerVAX executive team met with the UCLA research team for a pivotal project update regarding the Universal Cancer Vaccine Platform (“UCV”). &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The meeting took place in a conference room at the <a href="https://cnsi.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California NanoSystems Insititute</a> building, which incidentally overlooked another building where portions of the recent <strong><span>Oppenheimer</span></strong> <strong><span>movie</span></strong> was filmed.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>As a reminder, our Universal Cancer Vaccine is <strong><span>not a magic drug</span></strong> that cures all cancers. &nbsp;<strong><span>That doesn’t exist.&nbsp;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><span>It is a novel and customizable cancer immunotherapy platform</span></strong>, to be delivered as a simple shot, that uses cutting-edge bioengineering and molecular technologies to uniquely detect, mark and kill only cancer cells. &nbsp;By forcing cancer cells to express a unique marker not found in healthy cells, custom antibody drugs and the body’s immune cells may hopefully then target and destroy the cancer cells with precision. &nbsp;Current cancer treatments attack both cancer cells and healthy cells; CancerVAX is working to change this.</p>
                        <p>The UCV is based on a <strong><span>foundational “smart nanoparticle technology”</span></strong> that most likely can be customized to target specific cells and deliver customized cargos. &nbsp;In the past year, the UCLA team leveraged their extensive experience in oncology and nanoparticle technology along with their high-end research facilities, to produce viable UCV nanoparticle candidates. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The results were nanoparticles that have been tested in the lab to target and deliver cargos needed for the UCV to function with <strong><span>high delivery efficiency.</span></strong>&nbsp; What amazing progress!</p>
                        <p>Our Chief Marketing Officer, Byron Elton, summed up the meeting beautifully, “This meeting was an Oppenheimer moment for me!”</p>
                        <p><strong><span>Oh, one more thing. &nbsp;We made a surprising discovery…</span></strong> (to be continued tomorrow)</p>
