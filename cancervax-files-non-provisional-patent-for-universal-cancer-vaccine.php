            <h1>CancerVax Files Non-Provisional Patent for Universal Cancer Vaccine</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>The Company’s patent application describes how it plans to leverage cutting-edge CRISPR and mRNA technologies to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine (UCV)</h3>

        <p> LEHI, Utah, March 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CancerVAX, Inc., developer of a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, announced that it has recently filed a non-provisional patent application to protect its invention which leverages cutting-edge bioengineering techniques such as CRISPR and mRNA to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine (UCV).</p>
        <p>
            “This is a very important milestone for us,” said Ryan Davies, CancerVAX CEO. “We previously filed a confidential provisional patent in October 2021 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for our breakthrough universal cancer vaccine. Our regular utility patent application (nonprovisional) will now allow the USPTO to formally review our invention claims. If any claims are granted, we will have patent protection starting from the October 2021 provisional filing date.”</p>

        <p> Mr. Davies stated, “As we previously announced, our plan is to leverage existing cutting-edge biotechnologies, such as CRISPR and mRNA, to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine. Much like the COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines that will similarly leverage the body’s immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.”</p>

        <p>“Conventional cancer immunotherapy is based on finding protein markers or mechanisms that are naturally expressed in cancer cells and then developing custom antibodies or immune cells to target those specific protein markers for cell destruction,” Mr. Davies continued. “The main challenge with this approach is that human biology is not very predictable, and the natural protein markers often appear in healthy normal cells as well. As a result, any treatment targeting those natural markers often also affect normal cells. It is only through extensive human clinical trials that one can determine if a particular treatment is viable.”</p>

        <p> Mr. Davies concluded, “Instead, we plan to engineer a custom, non-naturally occurring protein marker for cancer cells to express, and then vaccinate against that. We believe that this is a novel approach which could help overcome cancer, a disease that according to the World Health Organization, is the second cause of death in the world.”</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>CancerVAX, Inc. is a pre-clinical biotechnology company developing a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Working with a team of experienced cancer researchers and physicians at UCLA, we intend to create a Universal Cancer Vaccine that will detect, mark, and destroy only the diseased cells with an incredibly high level of precision. Much like the COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, our cancer vaccine will leverage the body’s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. As we develop our universal cancer vaccine, we are also working with UCLA to develop single-disease cancer treatments targeting Ewing sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot.</p>
