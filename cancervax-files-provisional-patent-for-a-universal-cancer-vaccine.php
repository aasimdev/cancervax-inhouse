        <h3>The Company plans to leverage cutting-edge CRISPR and mRNA technologies in its quest to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine (UCV).</h3>

        <p>SANTA BARBARA, CA – October 6, 2021 – CancerVAX, Inc., a developer of immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced that it has filed a provisional patent to protect its invention which leverages cutting-edge CRISPR and mRNA technologies to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine (UCV).</p>
        <p>“For us, this is a very exciting announcement,” said Ryan Davies, CancerVAX CEO. “Biotechnology is evolving very rapidly. Our plan is to leverage existing cutting-edge biotechnologies, such as CRISPR and mRNA, to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine. Much like the COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines that train the body to target and destroy cancer cells.”</p>
        <p>“Conventional cancer immunotherapy is based on finding protein markers or mechanisms that are naturally expressed in cancer cells and then developing custom antibodies or immune cells to target those specific protein markers for cell destruction,” Mr. Davies continued. “The main challenge with this approach is that human biology is not very predictable, and the natural protein markers often appear in healthy normal cells as well. As a result, any treatment targeting those natural markers may also affect normal cells. It is only through extensive human clinical trials that one can determine if a particular treatment is viable.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies concluded, “Instead, we turned this problem on its head and asked, “What if we can engineer a custom non-naturally occurring protein marker for cancer cells to express, and then vaccinate against that? We are on a quest to develop a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine to do just that.”</p>
        <h3>About CancerVAX</h3>
        <p>CancerVAX, Inc. is developing immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Much like COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines that train the body to target and destroy cancer cells. Our immunotherapy platform is aimed at creating lower cost personalized CAR T-cell therapies as well as generalized antibody treatments through nanotechnology and gene-editing innovations. Our initial drug development is targeted at treating Ewing Sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. There is currently no FDA approved treatment to prevent recurrence. Our research is performed at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center by a leading cancer research team. We believe the resulting immunotherapy platform will be able to target other cancers such as adrenal cancer and brain cancer, as well as enabling the development of other vaccines and drugs.&nbsp;For more information about the Company, please visit <a href="https://cancervax948.e.wpstage.net/" target="_blank">https://cancervax948.e.wpstage.net/</a>.</p>
