                By leveraging cutting-edge bioengineering and molecular technologies, we are on a quest to develop innovative precision cancer immunotherapies. Inspired by the way COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines, also known as cancer immunotherapies, that uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. </p>

                        <p>We started working with UCLA in early 2021 on a single-disease immunotherapy targeted at Ewing Sarcoma, a deadly children’s cancer. Existing immunotherapies target natural cancer cell markers, which unfortunately appear in health cells as well, resulting in the destruction of healthy cells and causing various levels of toxicity and side effects. <br><br>
                            Through a series of brainstorm sessions that started in late 2021, we developed the concept of a customizable Universal Cancer Vaccine Platform (UCV) that can potentially target cancer cells with a high degree of precision and force only the cancer cells to express a unique marker that we can easily target for destruction. The UCV project kicked off in 2022. <br><br>
                            The UCV project progressed methodically with the development of various innovative technologies, including a foundational nanoparticle technology which can be programmed to target specific cells and deliver customized cargos. <br><br>
                            In a pivotal project meeting in the summer of 2023, the UCLA team reported positive progress on Ewing sarcoma and UCV. Surprisingly, the highly customizable low-cost nanoparticle technology developed for UCV can be adapted to perform an existing cancer immunotherapy (CAR-T Cell) at an extremely low cost. Thus, the Universal CAR-T Cell Platform was born. <br><br>
                            We now have a very exciting and important development pipeline consisting of three projects at UCLA.

                            <p>Based on the foundational nanoparticle technology developed for UCV, we are developing a novel Universal CAR-T Cell therapy, to be delivered as a shot, that can reprogram natural immune T-cells inside the body to seek and destroy any targeted cancer cells.


                                <br><br>
                                CAR-T cell therapy is a type of FDA-approved immunotherapy in which a patient’s T-cells are genetically modified in the laboratory, then reinjected back into the patient, so they will bind to specific proteins (antigens) found on cancer cells and kill them. These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells. Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than $500,000 per dose due to complicated and expensive lab processes. We believe we can dramatically lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose by simply helping the body make its own CAR T-cells.

Prior to that, he was the Director of the Comprehensive Tissue Bank at the University of Albert. Dr. Lakey is most well-known for co-inventing the “Edmonton Protocol”, along with Dr. James Shapiro, which aided in the improvement of islet isolation techniques for patients with Type 1 diabetes, a recognized major advancement in the treatment of diabetes. The Edmonton Protocol allows patients to receive islet transplants from the enzymes of cadavers and has had a success rate of over 75%. This development has informed treatments for diabetic patients, but has also opened the door for similar treatments for patients with cancer who have compromised organs from the disease or from chemotherapy and radiation. Dr. Lakey has done extensive research in the fields of oncology, stem cells and organ transplantation. He is the recipient of the Outstanding Leadership in Science Award from Alberta Science & Technology, Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Diabetes Association, Awards from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons and was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal (2005) by the Governor-General of Canada. Dr. Lakey has published over 495 scientific papers, 45 book chapters, submitted over 500 scientific abstracts and published a book on islet isolation.</p>
