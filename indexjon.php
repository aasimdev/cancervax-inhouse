                        <p>We are developing a Universal Cancer Vaccine (UCV) that will use the body’s own immune
                            system to target and eliminate cancer cells. The UCV will use cutting edge
                            bioengineering and molecular technologies to uniquely detect, mark and kill only cancer
                            cells. By forcing cancer cells to express a unique marker that healthy cells do not
                            have, custom antibody drugs and the body's immune system can target and destroy them
                            with precision. Additionally, we intend to make cancer cell look like common diseases so
                            that the body’s immune system can destroy them with ease. We have filed a patent
                            application for the UCV and are partnering with UCLA to develop the platform, which may
                            be administered as a one or two-shot treatment.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Denny has served as a physician at UCLA for over 3 decades primarily focused on
                                pediatric oncology. He has trained and mentored some of UCLA’s best and brightest
                                scientists and doctors in the field. Dr. Denny received a bachelor’s degree from
                                University of Pennsylvania and a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania
                                School of Medicine. He completed his residency at the Children’s National Medical
                                Center and fellowship at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Most of
                                Dr. Denny’s academic success has come through applying basic molecular biology tools
                                to seek molecular mechanisms for what he witnesses when treating pediatric
                                hematology/oncology patients.</p>
