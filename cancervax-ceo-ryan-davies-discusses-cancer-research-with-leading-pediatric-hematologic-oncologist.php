Outside of clinical practice, Dr. De Oliveira conducts clinical research on gene therapies in the fields of adoptive immunotherapy, pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pediatric red blood cell hematology, to name a few.</p>

        <p>As a pediatric oncology specialist, Dr. De Oliveira’s work impacts patients’ lives in real time. During the conversation, Dr. De Oliveira emphasized the impact of recent clinical research strides on his patients, “As I meet the families, I say, ‘Listen, 10 years ago, this disease would’ve killed this child. And now, this patient is a miracle,’ We’re really building the history of medicine.”</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>

        <p>CancerVAX, Inc. is a pre-clinical biotechnology company developing a breakthrough universal cancer vaccine that will use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Working with a team of experienced cancer researchers and physicians at UCLA, we intend to create a Universal Cancer Vaccine that will detect, mark, and destroy only the diseased cells with an incredibly high level of precision. Much like the COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, our cancer vaccine will leverage the body’s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. As we develop our universal cancer vaccine, we are also working with UCLA to develop single-disease cancer treatments targeting Ewing sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. We look forward to the day when treating cancer will be as simple as getting a flu shot.</p>
