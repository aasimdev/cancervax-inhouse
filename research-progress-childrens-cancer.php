                    <p>We started working with UCLA in early 2021 on a single-disease immunotherapy targeted at Ewing Sarcoma, a deadly children’s bone and soft tissue cancer. &nbsp;</p><p>There is currently no FDA approved treatment for recurrence. <strong><span  >Sadly, the death rate for patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma is 100%.</span></strong>&nbsp; Our work on this project could not be more important.</p><p>While we are very excited about the progress and potential of our innovative Universal Cancer Vaccine Platform and Universal CAR-T Cell Platform, <strong><span  >we want the fastest clinical path to a Ewing Sarcoma treatment.</span></strong>&nbsp; So, we focused on conventional immunotherapy approaches.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the UCLA research team successfully developed 7 antibody candidates. Six (6) have been fully humanized with confirmed targeting affinity for the Ewing sarcoma biomarker, two (2) of which will be used to develop CAR T-cell treatments, three (3) will be manufactured into bispecific antibodies. The next step is mouse studies, which precedes an application for human clinical trials.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are never guarantees in life, we are blessed to be working with UCLA, one of the top Ewing sarcoma centers in the world. In fact, one doctor/researcher member of our team, Dr. Noah Federman,<strong>&nbsp;is head of the Ewing sarcoma center at the</strong> <a href="https://cancer.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Dr. Federman has brought the research team together to solve this problem, which CancerVAX funded under a sponsored research agreement.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span  >You Can Help Us Fight the Good Fight Starting with $500 Today!</span></strong></p>
