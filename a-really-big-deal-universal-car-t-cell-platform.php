                       <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">HOT OFF THE PRESS!!!</span></strong></p><p>Did you see the press release from this morning?&nbsp;<a href="https://cancervax.com/ucart-announcement.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;(Link to Press Release)</a></p><p>We just announced an expanded development pipeline with UCLA to include a <strong><span  >low-cost Universal CAR-T Cell Platform.</span></strong></p><p>Remember the smart nanoparticle technology that UCLA developed for our Universal Cancer Vaccine Platform? Well… surprisingly, that highly customizable low-cost <strong><span  >nanoparticle technology can potentially perform an existing cancer immunotherapy (CAR-T Cell) at an extremely low cost.</span></strong>&nbsp; Thus, the Universal CAR-T Cell Platform was born.</p><p><strong><span  >CAR-T cell therapy is a type of FDA-approved immunotherapy</span></strong> in which a patient’s T-cells are genetically modified in the laboratory so they will bind to specific proteins (antigens) found on cancer cells and kill them. These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span  >Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than $500,000 per dose</span></strong> due to complicated and expensive lab processes. We believe we can potentially <strong><span  >lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose</span></strong> by simply helping the body make its own CAR-T cells</p><p>Instead of the time and expense of using external gene editing labs and other labs, we believe we can <strong><span  >turn your body’s immune system into its own CAR-T cell factory, with a simple injection. &nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Sounds like sci-fi? &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;That’s <strong><span  >similar to how the COVID mRNA vaccine works</span></strong>. &nbsp;It turns your own cells into a coronavirus spike protein factory, which then induces the body’s immune system to produce the matched anti-body to kill the actual coronavirus.</p><p>Ryan Davies, our CEO commented, “While no amount of money is too much to save a single human life, we hope to dramatically lower the cost of CAR-T cell therapy by 100 times and help save many lives.”</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span  >We are extremely excited about this new development!</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span  >You Can Help Us Fight the Good Fight Starting with $500 Today!</span></strong></p>
