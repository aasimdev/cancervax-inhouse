        <h3>The Company has entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with UCLA to develop a new cancer immunotherapy universal cancer vaccine</h3>
        <p>SANTA BARBARA, CA – August 31, 2022 – CancerVAX, Inc., a developer of immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced that it has entered into a second sponsored research agreement with the University of California Los Angeles (“UCLA”) to research and develop a universal vaccine to target multiple cancers. We will be developing a cancer vaccine platform to detect, mark and kill cancer cells by forcing cancer cells to express unique markers that healthy cells don’t have. Through this vaccine, we will teach the body’s immune system to identify, target and eliminate cancer cells with high precision. The vaccine will force cancer cells to express markers associated with well immunized diseases, such as COVID, allowing our treatments to make cancer cells look like diseases that the body already knows.</p>
        <p>This 24-month research program with UCLA commenced in August 2022, under the direction of Principal Investigator, Dr. Steven Jonas, Dr. Christopher Seet, Dr. Chris Denny, Dr. Satiro De Oliveira and Dr. Noah Federman from the UCLA Medical Center.</p>
        <p>CancerVAX has also executed an Option Agreement granting it exclusive rights to license all technologies and associated IP developed through cancer vaccine sponsored research agreement.</p>
        <p>“We are excited to work with the team at UCLA and share the mutual goal of developing an immunotherapy-based universal cancer vaccine,” said Ryan Davies, CEO of CancerVAX. “All of us are effected by cancer and it is our hope that this breakthrough vaccine can help the body’s own immune system detect, mark and kill many different types of cancer.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies concluded, “Our mission is to develop innovative and effective immunotherapy cancer treatments through our collaborations with leading medical researchers and clinicians.”</p>
        <h3>About CancerVAX</h3>
        <p>CancerVAX, Inc. is developing immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Much like COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines that train the body to target and destroy cancer cells. Our immunotherapy platform is aimed at creating lower cost personalized CAR T-cell therapies as well as generalized antibody treatments through nanotechnology and gene-editing innovations. Our initial drug development is targeted at treating Ewing Sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults.There is currently no FDA approved treatment to prevent recurrence. Our research is performed at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center by a leading cancer research team. We believe the resulting immunotherapy platform will be able to target other cancers such as adrenal cancer and brain cancer, as well as enabling the development of other vaccines and drugs.</p>
