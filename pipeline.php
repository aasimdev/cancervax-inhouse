            <p>We are developing a disease-specific immunotherapy targeted at treating Ewing Sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that affects children and young adults. There are currently no treatment options available for recurrence of Ewing Sarcoma. This research effort is led by a team of cancer researchers and physicians who run the Ewing Sarcoma Program at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. </p>

            <p>Based on the foundational nanoparticle technology developed for UCV, we are developing a novel Universal CAR-T Cell therapy, to be delivered as a shot, that can reprogram natural immune T-cells inside the body to seek and destroy any targeted cancer cells.
                <br><br>
                CAR-T cell therapy is a type of FDA-approved immunotherapy in which a patient’s T-cells are genetically modified in the laboratory so they will bind to specific proteins (antigens) found on cancer cells and kill them. These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells. Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than <span>$500,000 per dose</span> due to complicated and expensive lab processes. We believe we can dramatically <span>lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose</span> by simply helping the body make its own CAR T-cells.
            </p>
                            <h6>Conventional CAR-T Cell Therapy Steps:</h6>

                                <p>A patient’s T cells are removed from their blood. </p>
                                <p> The gene for a special receptor called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory by gene editing. The gene forces the T cell to express a protein (receptor) on its surface that binds to the cancer cell’s surface protein (antigen). </p>
                                <p>Millions of CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory. </p>
                                <p> They are then given to the patient by intravenous infusion. </p>
                                <p>The CAR protein on the surface of the CAR T cells bind to antigens on the cancer cells and kill them. </p>
                            </ul>
