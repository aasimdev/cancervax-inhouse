        <h3>New CEO Ryan Davies will lead the Company’s development of its breakthrough immunotherapy treatment</h3>
        <p>SANTA BARBARA, CA – October 1, 2021 – CancerVAX, Inc., a developer of immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer, today announced that Ryan Davies, formerly CEO of Curza, a small molecule therapeutics company, has joined the Company as its new CEO and will lead the Company’s development of its breakthrough immunotherapy treatment.</p>
        <p>“I am thrilled with this opportunity to lead the Company in its efforts to develop an immunotherapy breakthrough targeted at treating Ewing sarcoma,” said Mr. Davies. “This rare but deadly soft tissue and bone cancer primarily affects children and young adults. Because there is no current FDA approved treatment to prevent recurrence, I consider this to be a critical mission.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies concluded, “Also, I plan to use my biotech experience to help the Company develop other cancer vaccines. Over time, we hope to develop a full pipeline of innovative and effective cancer immunotherapy treatments and drugs.”</p>
        <h3>About CancerVAX</h3>
        <p>CancerVAX, Inc. is developing immunotherapy cancer treatments that use the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Much like COVID-19 vaccines that train the body to recognize and destroy the coronavirus, we are developing cancer vaccines that train the body to target and destroy cancer cells. Our immunotherapy platform is aimed at creating lower cost personalized CAR T-cell therapies as well as generalized antibody treatments through nanotechnology and gene-editing innovations. Our initial drug development is targeted at treating Ewing Sarcoma, a rare but deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. There is currently no FDA approved treatment to prevent recurrence. Our research is performed at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center by a leading cancer research team. We believe the resulting immunotherapy platform will be able to target other cancers such as adrenal cancer and brain cancer, as well as enabling the development of other vaccines and drugs.
