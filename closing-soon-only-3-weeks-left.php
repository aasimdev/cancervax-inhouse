                        <p>Hello Supporters,</p>
                        <p>We thank you for your interest and investment in our offering at StartEngine.</p>
                        <p>Our work with the team at UCLA has been mind blowing and has exceeded our expectations.</p>
                        <p>We chose UCLA because it is one of the TOP cancer research institutions full of oncologists and researchers who are pushing the boundaries on what is possible with cancer treatment.</p>
                        <p>Currently, over 100 types of cancers exist. In 2015 approximately $183 billion was spent on cancer health care, in the U.S. alone; that number is projected to grow to $246 billion by 2030.</p>
                        <p>The exciting progress by the UCLA research team has caused strong support, excitement, and growing investments from our private investors. As a result, we have decided to close the current Reg A+ offering at StartEngine early on November 7, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>CancerVAX has 3 viable pathways of growth with its current research program.</p>
